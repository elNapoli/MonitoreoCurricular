This project aims to improve the process of care of users who go to an office to complete a procedure, thereby optimizing the wait time in the endless queue of this service. \\

The overall objective of the project is to develop a system capable of requesting a number of care through an app for smartphones with Android operating system, and tracing Push Notifications tickets waiting for people who are in some center care, in order to optimize waiting times. That is, users could leave the premises and perform other procedures and thereby streamline your time. \\

Currently, the queues at the various centers have a manual ticket and customers must remain inside the enclosure. Emerging new technologies and widespread use, such as Smartphones, represent an opportunity to incorporate this technology into care process. In particular the design of a board to send notifications to the state of the row customer Smartphone. This information is stored and is the basis for generating various reports and with them improve the management of services. \\

In this project, a solution using cutting edge technology, which is the Web platform and the use of Smartphones with Android system for the use of information obtained and monitoring of queues is proposed. \\

Finally, define the best way to implement this system accompanied by a validation of this implementation. \\
